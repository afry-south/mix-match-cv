#### How can we become better at innovation?
Innovation day is good but one day is not always enough to actually come up with and investigate a particular idea. If AFRY really believes in innovation it could be worth to allocate a full week for projects. An individual wanting to innovate is not always enough, you need to have time and possibly funding.
Examples:
- Allocated time: N% Project: 3M, Google, Atlassian
- Spin-off/labs: Boston Dynamics, Amazon Kindle, loads of NASA spin-offs
