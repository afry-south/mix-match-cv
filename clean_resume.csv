WORK EXPERINCE
Title : Wipro Neural Intelligence Platform
Team Size : 5
Brief: Wiproâs Neural Intelligence Platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence
technologiesânatural language processing (NLP), cognitive, machine learning, and analytics. The platform
comprises three layers: a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and
unstructured data sources; an âintent assessment and reasoningâ engine that includes sentiment and predictive
analytics; and a deep machine learning engine that can sense, act, and learn over time. The project entailed
automating responses to user queries at the earliest. The Monster Bot using the power of Deep Machine Learning,
NLP to handle such queries. User can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like allL1 activities can be
eliminated.
Entity Extractor -> This involves text extraction and NLP for fetching out important information from the text like
dates, names, places, contact numbers etc. This involves Regex, Bluemix NLU apiâs and machine learning using
Tensor flow for further learning of new entities.
Classifier ->This involves the classifications of classes, training of dataset and predicting the output using the SKLearn
classifier (MNB, SVM, SGD as Classifier) and SGD for the optimization to map the user queries with the best
suited response and make the system efficient.
NER: A Deep Learning NER Model is trained to extract the entities from the text. Entities like Roles, Skills,
Organizations can be extracted from raw text. RNN(LSTM) Bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities
using Keras TensorFlow framework.

â Chat Bot using AWS LEX and Tensor flow  Python
The goal of project creates a chat bot for an academic institution or university to handle queries related courses offered by that institute. The objective of this task is to reduce human efforts as well as reduce man made errors. Even by this companies handle their client 24x7. In this case companies are academic institutions and clients are participants or students.
â Web scraping using Selenium web driver   Python
The task is to scrap the data from the online messaging portal in a text format and have to find the pattern form it.
â Data Visualization and Data insights   Hadoop Eco System, Hive, PySpark, QlikSense
The goal of this project is to build a Business Solutions to a Internet Service Provider Company, like handling data which is generated per day basis, for that we have to visualize that data and find the usage pattern form it and have a generate a reports.
â Image Based Fraud Detection   Microsoft Face API, PySpark, Open CV
The main goal of project is Recognize similarity for a face to given Database images. Face recognition is the recognizing a special face from set of different faces. Face is extracted and then compared with the database Image if that Image recognized then the person already applied for loan from somewhere else and now hiding his or her identity, this is how we are going to prevent the frauds in the initial stage itself.
â Churn Analysis for Internet Service Provider   R, Python, Machine Learning, Hadoop
The objective is to identify the customer who is likely to churn in a given period of time; we have to pretend the customer giving incentive offers.
â Sentiment Analysis   Python, NLP, Apache Spark service in IBM Bluemix.
This project is highly emphasis on tweets from Twitter data were taken for mobile networks service provider to do a sentiment analysis and analyze whether the expressed opinion was positive, negative or neutral, capture the emotions of the tweets and comparative analysis.

Quantifiable Results:
â Mentored 7-12 Data Science Enthusiast each year that have all since gone on to graduate school in Data Science and Business Analytics.
â Reviewed and evaluated 20-40 Research Papers on Data Science for one of the largest Data Science Conference called Data Science Congress by Aegis School of Business Mumbai.
â Heading a solution providing organization called Data Science Delivered into Aegis school of Data Science Mumbai and managed 4-5 live projects using Data Science techniques.

Migration of data from RDBMS database to Hive (Hadoop ecosystem) . Hadoop platform ability with strong data governance, lineage, auditing and monitoring capabilities. The objective of this project was to speed up the data processing so that the analysis and decision making become easy. Due to RDBMS limitations to process waste amount of data at once and produce the results at the earliest, Client wanted to move the data to Hadoop ecosystem so that they can over-come from those limitations and focus on business improvement only.

Responsibility 1. Optimising the SQL queries for those data which were not required to move from RDBMS to any other platform.
2. Writing the Hive queries and logic to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop ecosystem.
3. Writing the hive queries to analyse the required data as per the business requirements.
4. Optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the Hadoop resource utilizations.
5. Writing the sqoop commands and scripts to move the data from RDBMS to Hadoop side.

Project Description:
Pfizer Inc. is an American global pharmaceutical corporation headquartered in New York City. The main objective of the project is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc. Because all the downstream application are like Etrack, TSP database, RTS, SADMS, GFS, GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down. For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system. DDR process extracts all clinical, pre-clinical, study, product, subject, sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS, CDSS, RCM, PRC, E-CLINICAL, EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables. From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application.

Role & Responsibilities:
â To understand & analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries.
â To design Informatica mappings by using various basic transformations like Filter, Router, Source qualifier, Lookup etc and advance transformations like Aggregators, Joiner, Sorters and so on.
â Perform cross Unit and Integration testing for mappings developed within the team. Reporting bugs and bug fixing.
â Create workflow/batches and set the session dependencies.
â Implemented Change Data Capture using mapping parameters, SCD and SK generation.
â Developed Mapplet, reusable transformations to populate the data into data warehouse.
â Created Sessions & Worklets using workflow Manager to load the data into the Target Database.
â Involved in Unit Case Testing (UTC)
â Performing Unit Testing and UAT for SCD Type1/Type2, fact load and CDC implementation.
