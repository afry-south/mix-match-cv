Hampus Londögård 

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER/ENGINEER 

As a person I always strive to develop and improve my abilities. This I do by constantly trying to go outside of my sphere of security. This is one of the reason of why I started developing Android-apps. Developing apps meant that I had to not only consider effectiveness but also UX & design. 
  

Personally I'm very engaged and effective. Currently outside of my role as a consultant I am the driver of a competence group at ÅF in Natural Language Processing / Machine Learning. I'm also developing apps & small projects in my spare time. 
 

Personally outside of coding I deeply enjoy sports, gaming & hanging out with friends - perhaps cooking a dinner together?
