Executive summary
I am an ex-Big 4 Manager who specialised in the audit of the asset management space now working in buy-side
compliance at a top US hedge fund highly regarded in Asia/Singapore. I functioned in a managerial capacity and
successfully led teams while in PwC and am now both the sole associate actively managing the compliance program
in Singapore and lead manager of all external regulatory audits and internal audits for the company.
I have collectively 7+ years of experience in audit both from an external and internal perspective as well as regulatory
compliance. I hope that I will be able to contribute to your organisation as much as I can. Thank you for your
consideration and I look forward to hearing from you.
