CURRICULUM VITAE

Pinpay is Lebanon’s first handset-based, carrier-neutral, payment, mobile banking and
remittance ecosystem. Pinpay was “bootstrapped” with my angel investment; it has since
emerged as one of the country’s earliest, and most successful, venture capital “cover” stories.

 Built the company from “concept to enterprise” in under twelve (12) months
 Assembled distinct management team and advisory board, and rapidly grew the business
amidst one of the harshest political, economic and regulatory environments in the Middle East
 Earned goodwill; fostered trust relationships, and garnered early adoption (critical capital
commitments) from some of the leading banking institutions and VC investors in the region
 Attracted follow-on investments, ultimately negotiating a lucrative exit strategy, which
capitalized on five, grueling years of sheer determination and significant value-creation

2002-2012
Equity Partners (Kuwait City)

PARTNER, ORIGINATION & INVESTMENTS

A closely-held financial advisory and private placement boutique (“feeder fund”), offering its
balance sheet, value-added services, structured product distribution and professional
investment strategy to entrepreneurs, enterprises, fund managers, institutions, family offices
and UHNW investors throughout the Levant, Northern Africa & GCC region.

 Negotiated lowest GP (management) fees for our shareholders and clientele; worked directly
with the firm’s Chairman and Managing Director on matters of: fund/manager selection,
treasury decisions, asset allocation procedures as well as arbitrage and risk management
 Marketed (placed) a diverse range of six (6) absolute return funds: top-quartile managers,
covering an array of strategies, geographies and capital structures, to Sovereign, Institutional
& Family Offices, also sophisticated UHNW investors across Middle East, Europe and Far East
 Raised tremendous assets for fund managers; promoted strategic joint ventures, local
agencies and one-off deals, whilst developing trust relationships with notable, regional players
 Organized “road shows” to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain; built an extensive
LP rolodex (in excess of 700 relationships); bolstered existing GPs with follow-on capital, and
helped to launch many of the firm’s new, up-and-coming fund managers in the Middle East
 Grew assets under advisory and management from USD$4million, initially, to over
USD$1.3billion upon my departure; accomplished that in less than ten (10) years, despite
major market swings and even the global, financial meltdown of 2008
