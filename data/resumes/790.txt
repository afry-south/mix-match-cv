Reason of leaving:
Working environment is a bit far away from my expectation as I have not been informed in advance
about my department head (i.e. team head) is going to resign before I on board, and management is not
going to hire back an experienced senior to lead the team which makes me feel insecured because I do
not have sufficient experience to handle all tasks.
