Dear Sir/Madam
I am an inquisitive and international-minded team player who expresses great interest in applying for a position in the
field of client relationship management. I am ready for this challenge, and am determined to contribute beyond my
very best in furthering the successes of your esteemed organisation.
I graduated from Aston Business School with a BSc(Hons) in International Business and Economics (First Class) and
the programme includes a variety of international business and finance-based modules, as well as analytical and
research work on companies and global trends. The experience of studying abroad has broadened my knowledge on
the mechanics of the global economy and financial markets and increased my awareness on a wide range of
international issues.
As part of my degree at Aston, I underwent a year-long work placement with Lion Global Investors in Singapore. As a
Client Relations intern for over a year, I was responsible for the monthly production of over 30 fund factsheets which
required significant liaising with the compliance and data management teams and the fund managers. In addition to
the factsheet production, I had to coordinate information between the various departments in order to complete
monthly and quarterly fund questionnaires and due diligence reports as part of the direct support for the relationship
managers. Possessing knowledge on the various fund products and the monthly performance and fund manager’s
commentaries is crucial as I may have to be the first point-of-contact for certain information before any further
escalations to the relationship managers. Knowledge of AML and KYC were the necessary skills required for me to
perform my duties.
My 6-months contract stint with Credit Suisse AG supporting the London Client Relationship Management Group
(Soft Commission) has further honed my client management skills especially in the dealing of European and North
American clients (FIs, hedge funds etc.) The daily contact and liaising between my assigned clients and the RMs in
London has given me important exposure in a range of client requests from callbacks/SSI setups, invoicing,
operational inquiries to reconciliation and the setting up of client static information in the form of trade bookings and
soft commission rates.
Hence, I possess almost 2 years of solid client-dealing experience under my belt.
‘To be part of people’s solutions, not problems’ has always been my personal motto and I hope that my personal
inquisitiveness and experience will be a positive contribution to your esteemed organisation.
I have attached my CV for your reference and I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. Should you
have any questions regarding my application please do not hesitate to contact me on my mobile at 9780 2728 or email
me at weemjj@aston.ac.uk.
Yours faithfully

Joshua Wee
