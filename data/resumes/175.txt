PROFILE
I am a highly educated young professional well known for my determination, perseverance and reliability. Project
management, organisation and team coordination have been key in executing the deals and projects I run. My
exceptionally strong technical skills and excellent soft skills have made me stand out professionally. As someone who
is trilingual and has lived in five different locations I embrace cultural differences and believe in the power of
teamwork. I am seeking a new challenge where I can utilise my financial expertise and business judgment and push
myself to new boundaries.
