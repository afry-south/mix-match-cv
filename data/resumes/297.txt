Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a qualified Accountant of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and
CPA Australia. I have a Master degree in Applied Finance and two Bachelor degrees in
Business - majoring in Banking and Finance, and Accounting.

I am an Assistant Fund Operations Manager in an SFC licensed investment management firm
specializing in alternative investments. I have extensive financial product knowledge in both
listed and unlisted investments. The types of products include long/short equities, private
equities and OTC markets such as options, derivatives, futures and swaps as well as forex. My
main duties involve the preparation of fund’s Net Asset Value, review and reconciliation of fund
administrator’s valuation reports, preparation and compilation of monthly management reports,
reconciliation and maintaining investor transaction records, compliance-related issues and
project management. Previously, I worked at Standard Bank and HSBC in the Operations
Control Division and Alternative Fund Services Department respectively. My duties included
preparation of MIS report, KRI report and monthly operations updates, monitoring the
reconciliation of cash & holdings, fund administration, client relationship management, fund
valuations and implementing ad-hoc projects. Before HSBC, I was an auditor working in
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young for more than four and a half years, with over 1
year of IPO related experience.

In my previous positions, I have demonstrated creativity, strong analytical skills, and good
interpersonal skills. I have been rewarded by several promotions over the course of my career. I
have solid accounting, fund & banking knowledge and interact successfully with various parties
such as portfolio managers, fund administrators, prime brokers, legal consultants, corporate
secretaries and auditors. I am confident that I have the qualities and capabilities to fulfill the
duties required by the position. In my next role, I am looking for a position where I can continue
to exercise those skills.

Sincerely,
Anne Leung
