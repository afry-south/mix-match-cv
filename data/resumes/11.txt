SUMMARY
To seek an opportunity to apply my technology expertise along with my creative problem solving skills in an
innovative software company.

EXPERIENCE







Machine Learning Engineering Intern , Forsk Technologies , Jaipur (May,2017 – July,2017)
Learned the foundational concepts of data science and machine learning including python and statistics,
enough time was spent on understanding the concept behind each algorithm and examples and case
studies were done. Built some mid-scaled machine learning models using supervised and unsupervised
learning.
Software Engineering Intern , Proxbotics Creations Technologies , Jaipur (May,2016 – July,2016)
Developed and optimized various projects including ecommerce, booking & reservation, non-profit
organization Websites, using technologies: HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL etc.
Trainee at TecheduSoft , Kota (May,2015)
The course contains 15+ modules including Android Basics, fragments, screen designing, intents, various
views, signing app, web servers, web services, notifications, etc.

Video Analysis for surveillance
-A command line app which takes all your CCTV feeds as input and filters feeds with abnormal events
which results in 90% less videos to watch, Used image processing and deep learning algorithms,
outputs all time-stamps of interesting events for all feeds.
Food Calorie Estimator
-An android app to estimate calories present in food with still image. Trained own Data-set (Meal-net)
using Transfer learning Built upon Inception V3, Proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with 48 Layers, Developed a REST API to integrate it in Mobile apps, Optimized total computation time
~ 2 Seconds.
CryptoCurrency Market Predictor
- A Flask app to predict the future prices of various Crypto Currencies, implemented various supervised
and deep learning algorithms such as LSTM (RNN), polynomial regression, using scikit-learn, tensorflow,
keras etc.
Spam Filter
-A REST API to Detect Incoming SMS or Email as Spam or Ham which can be trained on your own data
set. Used NLP with Naive Bayes for Sentiment Analysis.

Image Classifier using CNN
-An application which detects objects present in a still image, implemented convolutional neural
network using open source machine learning library which can be run on multiple machines to reduce
training workloads, classifies objects using pre-trained image-net model.
Online Student and Faculty Portal
-A Web Portal to manage attendance of students and faculties, can be integrated to mobile apps. Uses
Php, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
Tax Accounting
-A Decentralized web app built on Ethereum Block-Chain using Truffle and Embark framework, which
can be used to transfer funds between accounts which automatically deducts tax from the account.
