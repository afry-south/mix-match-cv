Assignment Description and Requirements
As an Initiative Safety Manager you will be end-responsible for the overall safety Autonomous initiatives. Your involvement already starts during the analysis / contract negotiation phase where you identify and asses safety risks. Deployment of Initiatives starts after contract signage, implementing R&D developed solutions in specific Operational Design Domains. You plan, assess, execute and sign off on activities that assure and demonstrate that the solution is ‘autonomous ready’, before it will be used in operations and that it is continuously safe under operations. Activities include, but will not be limited to:

• Own the safety strategy for autonomous initiatives from deployment to operations, based on the solutions and related safety concepts developed by R&D
• Work with cross-functional teams to, during all project phases (concept, requirements, design, and verification & validation) identify, plan, establish, coordinate and follow up on initiative safety related activities, needed to fulfil the initiative safety goals and requirements
• Develop and maintain safety standards and procedures to manage safety risks, ensuring prompt follow-up and resolution. Definition of requirements for safety verification and validation
• Set-up and manage Initiative Safety Groups
• Identify and asses safety risks, hazards and causes and determine mitigation measures.
• Development of safety concepts, plans and procedures per initiative in accordance with relevant safety standards. Planning and tracking of work packages and tasks in accordance with the safety plan. Initiate, establish and maintain safety cases
• Develop, plan and implement periodic conformation reviews, audits and safety assessments and reporting. Perform qualitative and quantitative analysis
• Evaluating and ensuring compliance with company-, and relevant legal functional safety standards
• Oversee and implement the elements of the incident process including coordination of reporting, investigation, documentation and follow-up
• Monitor safety driver qualification and safety records
• Establish and maintain all relevant internal and external interfaces (e.g. customer, supplier, development team, manufacturing sites). Co-ordinate with colleagues that are responsible for solution safety and security and participate in product road mapping and in new product concept development. Coordinate development teams in performing safety analysis and analysing the results with respect to the technical safety concept. Guide and support the organization with safety expertise

• Optional: (In time) build, lead and manage a team of Functional Safety engineers
• Assess, plan, implement and evaluate learning and development programs
• Keep up to date with relevant trends and best practices. Assess and contribute to relevant upcoming standards in safety for autonomous driving.
• Promote a safety culture in Autonomous Solutions
