To whom it may concern,
I write to you expressing interest in roles currently open at your firm, and my resume is attached for review.
Let me assure you that my background is unlike most of the candidates that you may have seen, giving me a
unique perspective. My non-traditional career path consists of over 12 years of experience in business
development, operations, and strategy. Following those career experiences, I put myself through college while
operating my own business, and recently earned multiple degrees, including a master’s degree from MIT
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
After reviewing the roles and the required background in which your firm is looking for, I am confident that
my abilities match the needs and the culture of your firm perfectly. For example, I possess:
 Experience in enterprise asset management, strategy consulting, financial analysis, and value realization
across several industries, including FMCG, luxury goods, technology, automotive, and real estate


Stellar leadership and project management skills; ability to engage and lead multi-cultural teams for timely
delivery and execution. Exceptional interpersonal skills building relationship with internal/external clients

 Ability to operate strategically and tactically in intense environments with a high degree of organization
while managing multiple and competing priorities. Career experience in Southeast Asia and USA
 Experience delivering professional services focused on complex business problems involving commercial
and operational due diligence, post-merger integration and operational restructuring
I completed my post graduate rotation and consulting projects in Singapore and I am currently holding a
private equity related role in a global firm that I took on while I was finishing my degree from MIT. I am now
seeking something more challenging and rewarding in which to apply my talents. I look forward to the
opportunity to convey my strengths in an in-person interview.

Regards,

Joseph Falvella
