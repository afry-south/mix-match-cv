With 5 years’ experience in the accounting field, I had a long and successful career in accounting and more
specifically in the area of auditing. I am extremely knowledgeable about audit, compliance and advisory, books and
records maintenance, treasury and banking support. As an auditor for 4 years, I respond well to deadlines and
targets and I like to see tangible results. I am very fortunate to work on challenging, unique tasks distinctive from
regular works.
