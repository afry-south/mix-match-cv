Attn: Human Resources Department

Dear Sirs,
APPLICATION FOR THE POSITION OF VP, CORPORATE SECRETARIATIAL
I refer to my above application and am grateful for this opportunity to introduce myself.
I am a Chartered Company Secretary and an Associate of the Singapore Association of the Institute of the
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (“SAICSA”) since 2009. Currently, I have more than 12 years of
experience in the corporate secretarial line. Some of the essential skills that I have learnt and picked up over
the years include how to lead a team, an eye for detail, team-work, time management, how to be organised and
the ability to work individually were instilled in me and are transferrable skills that I can contribute to United
Overseas Bank Limited if I were selected.
Duties that I am responsible for in my current job include but are not limited to the drafting and vetting of
resolutions and correspondence, managing the corporate secretarial team, setting and maintaining the
governance framework for clients (when requested), develop and maintain best practices, liaising with external
professionals, filing of documents electronically with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority,
maintaining and updating of statutory records and ensuring that assistants’ work under my care are of an
acceptable standard and motivating them etc. In my last role as the company secretary of Koh Brothers Eco
Engineering Limited (a listed company in Singapore) from April 2013 to August 2016, my duties also include
providing corporate advisory support to the Board of Directors, assisting in the production of annual reports and
organising board and board committee meetings.
Having had years of practical experience in the corporate secretarial field, I have grown from strength from
strength and I have a mature attitude. My mature attitude will allow me to find solutions when there are
challenges faced in a fast-paced corporate environment. As a result, I strive to do my best in whatever I am
doing and try to do more of what is expected of me, whenever possible. This would mean that I am always on
the ball and able to respond to changes optimally.
I hold a Master of Science degree in Finance, Accounting and Management from the University of Bradford,
United Kingdom where I have lived for 2 years from 2009 to 2011. Having a Masters Degree majoring in
Finance, this has helped me to appreciate the finance aspects of my duties as a Company Secretary much better
which is vital for the banking industry.
Thank you for taking the time to look at my resume and I can be contacted at ng.therese@gmail.com or at my
mobile: +65 9635 4231.
Last but not least, I look forward to your favourable reply.

Yours faithfully,
Therese NG
