SUMMARY
Strong communication skills, problem identification and solution skills and strong professional
skepticism are the common words used to describe me by my superior. I have 9+ years of audit
experiences, and my proven track records comprised of statutory auditing, operational
auditing, compliance auditing, US SOX, grant audit, as well as auditing of information systems. My
creativity and passion in thinking on how people could beat the system have consistently enabled me
to identify potential internal controls weaknesses and recommended solutions to mitigate the risk.
My personality is best described as one who is highly reliable, pursues continual
improvements, minimum downtime, and ever-ready to coach and transfer my knowledge to
my peers and subordinates for succession planning. As I always try to exceed the expectations of
others, I tend to put in more effort and generally am able to perform above average.
I’m currently seeking for a role as regional internal audit manager in a sizeable MNC with regional
exposure opportunity, in order to add value to my career profile. I’m also looking for an opportunity
to further strengthen my team management skill. My career objective is to advance progressively to
become head of IA in the next 5 years or venture into business operations should opportunity arise.
