Cover Letter
I am writing to express my interest to be a corporate secretary
with your firm. In 2014, I obtained my Bachelor Degree in
Business Management from Liverpool John Moores University
(United Kingdom) and subsequently completed Institute of
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (ICSA) in 2016.
My first job after graduated from university was personal
assistance to managing director in Sabah, Malaysia. Half year
after working as personal assistance, I was encouraged to come to Singapore to learn and
practise as qualified chartered secretary. I am grateful that Tricor Singapore Pte. Ltd. has
given me the opportunity to growth in the path of being corporate secretary. Since
graduated and with few years of working experiences, I have acquainted myself with the
fundamental of company operation and a range of skills and knowledge that I obtained
throughout my study and working that would allow me to blend with the organisation’s
culture and propel the team to a new height of success.
Key strengths I offer are my responsibility and fast learner. During my study and step to
society, I gained valuable experience working with different teammates from diverse
backgrounds. I also learned to think on my feet. In addition, from being involved with
extracurricular groups during college and maintaining good grades at the same time, I know
that I can handle multiple responsibilities and successfully meet deadlines.
Together with the cover letter, I enclosed herewith my resume and educational certificates
for your full consideration. I appreciate your time reviewing my application.
I will be much appreciate if you able to give me an opportunity to interview with you. I
can be contacted at 81107708 (mobile) or lee_rachel@live.com (e-mail). It will be a
pleasure for me to attend an interview with you.

Thank You

Yours Sincerely,
